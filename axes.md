Axes


Once upon a time there lived a man on the edge of a great forest. Each morning he rose, readied himself, and went to the forest to continue his life’s work as a logger. He spent long days with his trusty axe cutting down trees to use in making a life for himself. Each day, he entered the forest looking for something. However, even returning home with the most beautiful and bountiful bundles of wood, he continued to search.

“If only my life had more meaning,” he would ponder. “There must be more to life than these endless days of work, and this forest that stretches to the horizon.”

Day after day, this discontent grew. He had a routine, and a place in the world, but it did not satisfy him.

One morning, on his trip into the woods, a traveler passed him on the road. She was apparently wealthy, and carried with her the supplies of a nomadic merchant. He saw her wealth and success, and wondered how she had found such a lucrative path through life. As they stopped and talked with one another, the man thought to question the traveler.

The merchant, glad to share her experience, told him stories of her life.

Every day she traveled from market to market, with valuable goods from all over the world. Her goods were always the finest on the market because she was a skilled barterer with great experience. Every transaction made her money, and her accounts were always well tended, but every night when her transactions were settled, she sighed in relief because her work tired her.

“If only I had more time for myself,” she thought. “I am a slave to my customers because they are the ones who choose how I spend my time.”
