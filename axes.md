Axes

Chapter 1

Once upon a time lived a man on the edge of a great forest. Each morning he rose, readied himself, and went to the forest to continue his life's work as a logger. He spent long days with his trusty axe cutting down trees to use in making a life for himself. Each day, he entered the forest looking for something. However, even returning home with the most beautiful and bountiful bundles of wood, he continued to search.

"If only my life had more meaning," he would ponder. "There must be more to life than these endless days of work, and this forest that stretches to the horizon."
