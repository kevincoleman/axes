Axes


Once upon a time there lived a man on the edge of a great forest. Each morning he rose, readied himself, and went to the forest to continue his life’s work as a logger. He spent long days with his trusty axe cutting down trees to use in making a life for himself. It was a good life; some might call it nearly perfect in its simplicity. However, Each day he entered the forest looking for something. Even returning home with the most beautiful and bountiful bundles of wood, he continued to search.

“If only my life had more meaning,” he would ponder. “There must be more to life than these endless days of work, and this forest that stretches to the horizon.”

Day after day, this discontent grew. He had a routine, and a place in the world, but it did not satisfy him.

One morning, on his trip into the woods, a traveler passed him on the road. She was apparently wealthy, and carried with her the supplies of a nomadic merchant. He saw her wealth and success, and wondered how she had found such a lucrative path through life. As they stopped and talked with one another, the man thought to question the traveler.

The merchant, glad to share her experience, told him stories of her life.

Every day she traveled from market to market, with valuable goods from all over the land. Her goods were always the finest on the market because she was a skilled trader with great experience. Every transaction made her money, and her accounts were always well tended. At the end of every night, when her transactions were settled, she sighed in relief because her work tired her.

“If only I had more time for myself,” she thought. “I am a slave to my customers because they are the ones who choose how I spend my time. If only this problem were fixed, my life would be better.” So she kept trading goods, keeping a keen watch for anyone who had found a better way of living.

One day the merchant’s job took her to the courts of a great ruler. Remembering her search for a better way, she talked to the ruler, asking him how she might achieve a life as perfect as his.

The ruler shared his viewpoint, imparting stories of great wisdom.

His job as ruler of a great and prosperous land had given him many luxuries. He ate whatever food he pleased, wore whatever clothes he wanted, and bowed to no master. Every day his servants waited on him, tending to his every desire.
