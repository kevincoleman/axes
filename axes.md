Axes
====

Once upon a time there lived a man on the edge of a great forest. Each morning he rose, readied himself, and went to the forest to continue his life’s work as a wood smith. He spent long days with his trusty axe cutting down trees to use in making a life for himself. It was a good life, though simple and not lavish. Each day he entered the forest looking for something. Even when he returned home with beautiful and bountiful bundles of wood, he continued to search.

“If only my life had more meaning,” he mused. “There must be more to life than these endless days of work and this forest that stretches to the horizon.”

Day after day, his discontent grew. He had a routine, and a place in the world, but they did not satisfy him.

One morning on his trip into the woods a traveler passed him on the road. She was apparently wealthy, and carried with her the supplies of a nomadic merchant. He saw her wealth and success, and wondered how she had found such a lucrative path through life. As they stopped and talked with one another, the man thought to question the traveler.

The merchant, glad to share her experience, told the wood smith stories of her life.

Every day she traveled from market to market, with valuable goods from all over the land. Her goods were always the finest because she was a skilled trader with great experience. Every transaction served her well, and her accounts were always well attended. At the end of each night when her transactions were settled she sighed in relief, tired from the day.

“If only I had more time for myself,” she thought. “I am a slave to my customers because they are the ones who choose how I spend my time. If only this problem were fixed, my life would be better.” So she kept trading goods, keeping a keen watch for anyone who had found a better way of living.

One day the merchant’s job took her to the courts of a great ruler. Remembering her search for a better way, she talked to the ruler, asking him how she might achieve a life as perfect as his.

The ruler shared his viewpoint, imparting stories of great wisdom.

His job as ruler of a great and prosperous land had given him many luxuries. He ate whatever food he pleased, wore whatever clothes he liked, and bowed to no master. Every day his servants waited on him, tending to his every desire. He lived without fear or trouble, but his life was not quite perfect.

“I cannot leave this position where people look up to me,” he mused. “Being great in the eyes of others has its own kind of weight. I am responsible to answer for their needs at all times. If only my people could require less of me. I would search out a more peaceful lifestyle—then I would have the perfect life.”

Being a rich ruler, he began a search for someone who lived peacefully in order to see how it’s done. He brought in people from all over the land, but found no one with a simple life. For months he searched far and wide until finally a monk from the mountains came to the him. He asked the monk how to have a peaceful life.

The monk slowly and thoughtfully answered, and he shared stories from his life in the high mountain monastery.

He spent his days in the heights of the mountain peaks, looking over vast lands and watching storms come and pass. The chipmunks, beetles, and eagles visited him, bringing him stories of the forest below. He cared for his environment faithfully. He knew no adversity, no trials and no sadness. His life was peaceful and serene, and his sage wisdom remained unobstructed by politics or petty squabbles.

One evening, as he watched the swallow dive and swoop around the swirling mountain clouds, he wished to himself, “if only I could experience the joy of the swallow as he rides the weather’s wishes. Then I would be content to live for ages, with the joy of youth captured under my wings.”

When the swallow came to visit him that night, he asked it, “how can it be that I have such a peaceful life, but still I long for youth as you have? Can you show me the secret to being happy regardless of age?”

The swallow knew exactly where to take the monk, and together they set out down the mountainside. They traveled down the snowy slopes, across the shattered mountain rocks, and into the evergreens. Walking deeper and deeper into the luminous forest, they came to a solemn place where no sound was heard, and the breeze did not dare blow. The bird stopped, perching on a branch of the oldest tree in the forest. As he leaned in close, the tree stirred, making a sound as soft as that of eyelashes rubbing together. It was nigh impossible to tell if the tree was speaking or only thinking, but never the less its words could be sensed:

“I have been here longer than any living creature. I have seen this land become all that it is, and I am as content now as I was when I first sprouted. I will share with you the secret of my serenity. You need only to—”

*Crack!*

A sound rang out in the stillness of the glade.

*Crack!*

Bark splintered and flew, as the forest life curdled in fear.

*Crash!*

In a deafening symphony of cracking and creaking, the woodsmith’s axe brought the ancient tree to the forest floor.

As the wood smith hauled his wood home, he sighed a sigh of discontent.
